# Deploying Nytro

So you just got access to a spiffy new codebase.

How then, to deploy the end product? The code won't feel real until you can get a working demo on the actual web.

We'll need two things:
- A deployment provider (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
- A database hosting provider (AWS RDS, Railway, Compose, etc.)

In the interest of keeping costs low and deployment relatively straightforward, this section will document the Vercel and AWS RDS pipeline.
